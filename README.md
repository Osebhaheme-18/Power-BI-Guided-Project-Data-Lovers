# Business Problem 
The hotel management team lacked a centralized, data-driven view of business performance across regions and customer segments. Key metrics such as total bookings, revenue, cancellations, and customer behavior were scattered across multiple sources, making it difficult to identify trends or optimize decision-making.
This project aims to build an interactive Power BI dashboard that consolidates hotel data from 2018–2020, enabling stakeholders to monitor performance, analyze booking behavior, and uncover insights to reduce revenue loss and improve operational efficiency.

# Project Objectives
To create a Power BI dashboard that visualizes hotel performance between 2018 and 2020, providing insights into bookings, revenue, cancellations, and customer behavior for better strategic decision-making.

This project enabled us to accomplish the following significant outcomes:
## Understand Business Objectives and User Requirements
We undertook a thorough analysis of the business problem to understand its objectives and requirements, pinpointing the main focus areas and formulating the key questions to be answered.
## Define Business Questions and Metrics
Following the analysis conducted in Step 1, we established a set of targeted business questions that the dashboard aims to resolve. Example questions include:
- Average Lead Time for Hotel Bookings
- Average Daily Rate (ADR) by Month (2018)
- What is the overall hotel performance in terms of total bookings, revenue, and revenue loss?
- How do weekday and weekend performances compare in terms of bookings and revenue?
- What are the patterns in booking behavior, such as lead time and deposit type and how they impact revenue?
## Identify the metrics and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that will provide insights to answer the defined business questions.
Examples of metrics
- Total Revenue
- Average Lead Time
- Total Bookings
- Revenue Loss
- Average Daily Stay
## Dataset preparation:
We cleaned the dataset by removing duplicates, fixing inconsistencies, and formatting it appropriately for analysis and visualization.
