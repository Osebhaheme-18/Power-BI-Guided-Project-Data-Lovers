# Business Problem 
The hotel management team lacked a centralized, data-driven view of business performance across regions and customer segments. Key metrics such as total bookings, revenue, cancellations, and customer behavior were scattered across multiple sources, making it difficult to identify trends or optimize decision-making.
This project aims to build an interactive Power BI dashboard that consolidates hotel data from 2018–2020, enabling stakeholders to monitor performance, analyze booking behavior, and uncover insights to reduce revenue loss and improve operational efficiency.
